# unit_testing_example_two

Welcome to the Flutter Software Testing Project repository! This project aims to demonstrate various software testing techniques and best practices in Flutter app development.

 
## Overview

This example demonstrates how to implement unit tests for increment and decrement methods of a counter, conduct widget tests to verify button press functionality, and perform integration tests to ensure the correct behavior of all functions and widgets.

This project includes examples and implementations of different types of software testing in Flutter:

- Unit Testing
- Widget Testing
- Integration Testing
- End-to-End (E2E) Testing
  
## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

- `lib/`: Contains the main Flutter application code.
- `test/unit_test.dart/`: We Apply unit tests for methods increment and decrement.
- `test/widget_test.dart/`: We apply Widget tests.
- `test_driver/`: We Apply Integration tests.
  
## Testing Tools and Libraries
This project utilizes the following testing tools and libraries:

- `flutter_test`: Official Flutter testing library for unit and widget tests.
- `flutter_driver`: Flutter package for writing E2E tests using Flutter Driver.
- `test`: Dart testing library for writing tests and assertions.

## UI Example
The following demonstrates the result of integration testing. Ensure that you are in the project directory before running this command in the terminal:
```bash
flutter drive --target=test_driver/integration.dart
```
